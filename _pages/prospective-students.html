 I am always keen to work with highly motivated students. If you are interested, please email me at <a href="mailto:mojtaba.shahin@rmit.edu.au">mojtaba.shahin@rmit.edu.au
</a> and briefly outline your research interests. Below are several potential research themes to consider; these are indicative rather than exhaustive.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Having 1–2 papers in top-tier Computer Science and Software Engineering conferences will increase your chances!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The projects mainly target <strong>Software Engineering for AI (SE4AI)</strong>
  and <strong>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</strong>.
</p>

<h3> Research Theme 1. Human-Centred AI-based Software Systems Engineering </h3>
<p>
 AI-based software systems (software system that incorporates AI capabilities) are becoming an important and integrated part of our lives and society. From a software engineering perspective, AI-based software systems differ from non-AI systems and possess unique characteristics. This implies that new and/or revised software engineering practices and tools are needed to develop such systems. At the same time, there is an urgent need to ensure that AI-based software systems do not violate the ethical and social concerns of their various stakeholders and end-users. This research theme aims to (i) develop novel tools, processes, practices, and guidelines to engineering human-centred AI-based software systems, (ii) carry out social and ethical assessments of AI-based software systems, and (iii) propose concrete solutions to identify and mitigate social and ethical concerns in AI-based software systems.
</p>

<h3>Research Theme 2. Human Values and Human-centric Issues in AI-based Systems</h3>
<p>
The goal of this research theme is to develop and evaluate well-established AI/LLM techniques to effectively detect, track, and classify human values and human-centric issues in AI-based systems by mining a broader range of software artifacts, including source code and developer discussions captured in code comments and issue-tracking systems.

</p>

<h3>Research Theme 4. Socio-technical Aspects of Securing AI-based Systems</h3>
<p>
  This research theme aims to investigate security in AI-based systems from a socio-technical perspective. Specifically, it explores when and how developers should integrate and practice security in AI-based systems, how developers use security tools and security-related code recommended by AI tools, and the socio-technical factors that impact developers when making security decisions.
