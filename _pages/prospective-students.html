<p>
  I am always looking for highly-motivated students! Please send me an email
  (<a href="mailto:mojtaba.shahin@rmit.edu.au">mojtaba.shahin@rmit.edu.au</a>)
  and share your research interests. There are some interesting research projects
  that you can work on:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Having 1–2 papers in top-tier Computer Science and Software Engineering conferences will increase your chances!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The projects mainly target <strong>Software Engineering for AI (SE4AI)</strong>
  and <strong>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Project 1. Architecting AI-based Systems</h3>
<p>
  This PhD project aims to support architecting AI-based systems by conducting
  empirical studies and developing practical solutions, design principles, and tools.
  More specifically, the project provides a deep understanding of architectural
  concerns and quality attributes in the development and deployment of AI-based
  systems and develops practical architectural solutions to design, evaluate,
  and monitor AI-based systems.
</p>

<h3>Project 2. DevSecOps-driven Software Architectures</h3>
<p>
  This PhD research project aims to provide guidelines and tools with empirical
  evidence that allow software organisations to develop, apply, manage, and
  evaluate security architecture solutions and mechanisms in DevSecOps environments.
</p>

<h3>Project 3. Human Values and Human-centric Issues in Machine Learning Systems</h3>
<p>
  The goal of this PhD project is to develop and evaluate well-established AI
  techniques to effectively detect, track, and classify human values and
  human-centric issues in machine learning systems by mining source codes and
  developer discussions captured in code comments and issue tracking systems.
</p>

<h3>Project 4. Socio-technical Aspects of Securing Machine Learning Systems</h3>
<p>
  This PhD project aims to investigate security in machine learning systems from
  a socio-technical perspective. Specifically, it explores how and when developers
  should integrate and practice security in machine learning systems, how ML
  developers use security tools and security-related code recommended by AI tools,
  and what socio-technical factors impact AI developers while making security decisions.
