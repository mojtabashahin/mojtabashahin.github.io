 I am always keen to work with highly motivated students. If you are interested, please email me at <a href="mailto:mojtaba.shahin@rmit.edu.au">mojtaba.shahin@rmit.edu.au
</a> and briefly outline your research interests. Below are several potential research themes to consider; these are indicative rather than exhaustive.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Having 1–2 papers in top-tier Computer Science and Software Engineering conferences will increase your chances!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The projects mainly target <strong>Software Engineering for AI (SE4AI)</strong>
  and <strong>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</strong>.
</p>

<h3> Research Theme 1. Engineering AI-based Systems</h3>
<p>
  This research theme aims to support engineering AI-based systems by conducting
  empirical studies and developing practical solutions, design principles, and tools.
  More specifically, the research theme aims to develop a deep understanding of the development and deployment of AI-based
  systems and develops practical solutions to design, evaluate, and monitor AI-based systems.
</p>


<h3>Research Theme 2. Human Values and Human-centric Issues in AI-based Systems</h3>
<p>
  The goal of this research theme is to develop and evaluate well-established AI/LLM
  techniques to effectively detect, track, and classify human values and
  human-centric issues in AI-based systems by mining a wider range of software artifacts, such as source codes and
  developer discussions captured in code comments and issue tracking systems.
</p>

<h3>Research Theme 3. Socio-technical Aspects of Securing AI-based Systems</h3>
<p>
  This research theme aims to investigate security in AI-based systems from
  a socio-technical perspective. Specifically, it explores how and when developers
  should integrate and practice security in AI-based systems, how developers use security tools and security-related code recommended by AI tools,
  and what socio-technical factors impact developers while making security decisions.
