<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to a U.S. Associate Professor) in the School of Computing Technologies at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia. Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. I completed my PhD study in Computer Science with a major in Software Engineering in 2018 at The University of Adelaide, Australia.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">My research has resulted in over <strong>70 peer-reviewed publications</strong>, including papers in top-tier venues such as the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, and the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering. According to Google Scholar (November 2025), my work has received <strong>+4,400 citations</strong>, with an h-index of 30 and an i10-index of 51. Additionally, in 2023, 2024 and 2025, I was recognised by Stanford University and Elsevier as <strong>one of the top 2% most cited researchers in the world in the Software Engineering field__ for ‘single year impact’</strong>.</p>

Research Interests 
======
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am passionate about advancing Software Engineering (SE) research to address the challenges of developing ethical, trustworthy, and high-quality AI-based software systems. My research aims to develop a deep understanding of how large-scale AI-based software systems are developed, designed, and evaluated in the industry to create innovative tools, processes, theories, and frameworks that enhance their reliability, ethical alignment, and societal impact. </p>
