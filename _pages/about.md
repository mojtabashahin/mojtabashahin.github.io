I am a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to a U.S. Associate Professor) in the School of Computing Technologies at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia. Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. I completed my PhD study in Computer Science with a major in Software Engineering in 2018 at The University of Adelaide, Australia. My research has resulted in over 70 peer-reviewed publications, including papers in top-tier venues such as the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, and the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering. According to Google Scholar (November 2025), my work has received +4,400 citations, with an h-index of 30 and an i10-index of 51. Additionally, in 2023, 2024 and 2025, I was recognised by Stanford University and Elsevier as one of the top 2% most cited researchers in the world in the Software Engineering field for ‘single year impact’.

Research Interests 
======
I am passionate about advancing Software Engineering (SE) research to address the challenges of developing ethical, trustworthy, and high-quality AI-based software systems. My research interests primarily reside in Software Engineering for AI, AI for Software Engineering, the Human, Social, and Ethical Aspects of Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Empirical Software Engineering, DevOps, Secure Software Engineering, and Qualitative Research. My research aims to develop a deep understanding of how large-scale AI-based software systems are developed, designed, and evaluated in the industry to create innovative tools, processes, theories, and frameworks that enhance their reliability, ethical alignment, and societal impact.
